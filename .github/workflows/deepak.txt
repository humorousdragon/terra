The application I needed to deploy is a monolithic NodeJS application, so, to deploy and make it scalable I decided to use containers with an autoscaling tool to scale the application based on CPU and Memory usage. To build this environment on AWS I used the services listed below:

1. VPC and Networking (Subnets, Internet Groups...)
2. Elastic Container Registry
3. Elastic Container Service
4. Application Load Balancer
5. Auto Scaling
6. Cloud Watch
